# Data Wrangling in Numpy

![](numpy.png)

Most analysts only use np.array() for their projects, but numpy has a host of numerical functions that will make your life easier.

# What is Numpy Really Used for ?
NumPy is a powerful library in Python used for numerical computing. It provides a wide range of mathematical functions and operations that are optimized for efficiency and performance. In this blog post, we will explore some of the most commonly used NumPy functions with examples.


## 1. 'numpy.array()'

This function is used to create an array in NumPy. We can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object to create a new NumPy array

```python
import numpy as np

# creating a 1D array
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(arr1)

# creating a 2D array
arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(arr2)
```
Output:
```python
[1 2 3]
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
```

```python

```

```python

```

```python

```
